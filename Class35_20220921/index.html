Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all the instructions are delivered through the Internet now, so students don't have to leave their homes and attend institutions to learn something new. They have become more independent since it's not required to be in a certain place at a specific time. Remote studying added more flexibility in students' lives, which made the education more accessible for individuals that don't have the possibility to attend classes.</p>
